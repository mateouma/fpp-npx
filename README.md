# fpp-npx: Using filtered point process modeling to disentangle neuronal contributions to electrophysiological power spectra

Code I used to analyze electrophysiological data under the guidance of Dr. Emily Stephen at Boston University. Here, I used filtered point process forward and inverse modeling to examine the neuronal contributions to the power spectra with Neuropixels data from macaque monkeys.
